# :duck: Welcome to Construct-A-Duck :duck:

Coding (and life) can be challenging. Sometimes it's nice to share your problems with a little buddy? Having a physical rubber duck is nice, but sometimes they aren't always available.

Fret not! Cosntruct-A-Duck lets you color, name, and save a little 3-D pal to tell your worries to.

Login and save your buddies to your 'nest' and come back visit them later.

## Ready to get started?
